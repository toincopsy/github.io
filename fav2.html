                In the study by Moberg, Niles and Beermann (2019), the researchers investigated the effectiveness of the
                <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-original-title="Fist tooltip">Pacifica</a> smartphone
                application, as a self-help intervention for individuals suffering from mild to
                moderate symptoms of stress, anxiety and depression. They used a randomized, controlled waiting list
                study to do so. Given the increasing prevalence of mental illness and the widespread use of mobile
                technology, this study explores the potential of Pacifica to provide accessible and effective mental
                health support.

                The study design compared two groups: an immediate intervention group (Pacifica) with 253 participants
                and a waiting list control group (WL) with 247 participants, resulting in a total of 500 recruited
                participants. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the two groups and assessed using
                self-assessments of stress, anxiety, depression, and self-efficacy.
                <br>
                <br>
                The Pacifica group was provided access to the app for one month, with no required level of use to mimic
                real-world app usage. Meanwhile, the WL group had access to the intervention after a one-month waiting
                period. Participants in both groups were assessed at two time points: baseline (pre treatment), 4 weeks
                later (post treatment; end of the intervention period). A follow-up assessment was completed only by the
                Pacifica group 3 months after the baseline/2 months post intervention (follow-up).

                showing promising effects on anxiety and stress reduction.
